## Exercise 2: E-commerce Platform Search Function

### Understanding Asymptotic Notation

Big O notation is a mathematical notation used in computer science to describe the performance or complexity of an algorithm. It specifically describes the worst-case scenario, or the maximum time an algorithm will take to complete.

Big O notation helps in analyzing algorithms by:

1. Providing a standardized way to compare algorithm efficiency.
2. Allowing us to predict an algorithm's performance as input size increases.
3. Helping in making decisions about which algorithm to use based on input size and performance requirements.

For search operations:

- Best-case scenario: The item is found immediately (first try).
- Average-case scenario: The item is found after a typical number of operations.
- Worst-case scenario: The item is found after the maximum number of operations or not found at all.

### Analysis

Time complexity analysis for each operation:

1. Linear Search:

   - Best case: O(1) - the item is found at the first position
   - Average case: O(n) - the item is found after checking half the items on average
   - Worst case: O(n) - the item is at the last position or not in the array

2. Binary Search:

   - Best case: O(1) - the item is found at the middle position
   - Average case: O(log n) - the search space is halved in each step
   - Worst case: O(log n) - the item is at one of the ends or not in the array

Binary search is generally more suitable for an e-commerce platform search function
