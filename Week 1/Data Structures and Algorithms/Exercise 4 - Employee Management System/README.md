## Exercise 4: Employee Management System

### Understanding Array Representation

1. Memory Representation:

   - Arrays are stored in contiguous memory locations.
   - Each element in the array occupies the same amount of memory.
   - The memory address of each element can be calculated using its index and the size of each element.

2. Advantages of Arrays:

   1. Random Access: Elements can be accessed directly using their index, providing O(1) time complexity for access operations.
   2. Memory Efficiency: Arrays use a relatively small amount of memory overhead compared to more complex data structures.
   3. Cache Friendliness: Due to their contiguous memory allocation, arrays often benefit from CPU cache optimizations.
   4. Simplicity: Arrays are straightforward to understand and use.
   5. Performance: Many operations on arrays are very fast, especially when working with primitive data types.

### Analysis

Time complexity analysis for each operation:

1. Add:

   - Best case and Average case: O(1)
   - Worst case: O(n)

2. Search:

   - Best case: O(1)
   - Average case and Worst case: O(n)

3. Traverse:

   - Always O(n)

4. Delete:

   - Best case: O(1)
   - Average case and Worst case: O(n)
