## Exercise 5: Task Management System

### Understanding Linked List

1. Singly Linked List:

   - Each node has data and a pointer to the next node.
   - Traversal is possible in only one direction (forward).
   - Takes less memory per node.
   - Simpler to implement but less flexible than doubly linked lists.

2. Doubly Linked List:

   - Each node has data, a pointer to the next node, and a pointer to the previous node.
   - Traversal is possible in both directions (forward and backward).
   - Takes more memory per node due to the extra pointer.
   - More flexible but slightly more complex to implement than singly linked lists.

### Analysis

Time complexity analysis for each operation:

1. Add:

   - Best case and Average case: O(1)
   - Worst case: O(n)

2. Search:

   - Best case: O(1)
   - Average case and Worst case: O(n)

3. Traverse:

   - Always O(n)

4. Delete:

   - Best case: O(1)
   - Average case and Worst case: O(n)
